I graduated from `Istanbul University`, ELT Department in 2002. After I graduated, I began to work as an English and drama teacher in a private school. Since my undergrad years, I have been teaching English and Turkish (as a foreign language). Among many institutions, I also worked at IH (International House) and EF (English First). Upon teaching, I have been working as a freelance translator (Eng-Tur and Tur-Eng). Since 2005, I have been working as a research assistant at Yildiz Technical University, Faculty of Education, Foreign Languages Education Department. In 2009-2010 academic year, I taught Turkish at the `University of Georgia`, Athens, GA as a Fulbright FLTA. 

I have an MA degree in Teaching Turkish as a Foreign Language from `Yildiz Technical University`. Also, I hold a PhD degree in Linguistics with a focus on lexicography from `Ankara University` and worked with [Prof.Dr. Nadir Engin Uzun](https://www.google.com/search?q=Prof+Dr+Nadir+Engin+Uzun){: target="_blank"}.
